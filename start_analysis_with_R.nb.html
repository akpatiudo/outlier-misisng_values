Data Uniformity: A Statistic Assessment and management of Outlier and Missing Values In R

Introduction
The uniformity of a dataset helps the analyst to get an accurate result or an higher accuracy; two major issues to accuracy are from outliers and missing values not handled well. Thus, pre-processing of your data value is the crucial point of any analysis and the focal point of any analyst whose interest is getting accurate insight from the dataset.

Donald Rubin Statement: “Missing data are just another example of outliers.” Donald Rubin highlighted the connection between missing data and outliers. He viewed missing data as a form of outliers, indicating observations that are different from the complete data. Rubin’s statement suggests that missing data should be treated as a distinct type of outlier in data analysis. 

I looked into this analysis under the following subtopics below:
Tukey’s rule
Data Source
Loading and calling up required packages
Summary Information of My Dataset
Sort the BMI columns
Imputing Missing values
Removing Missing Values:
Replacing Missing Values
BagImpute Method of Handling Missing Values
None Parametic Test
Quantitative Nomality
Analyze the P value of Skewness and Kurtosis
Handling Outlier in dataset
Method one
Comperision
Method 2

In summary, if you are primarily concerned with imputing missing values in your dataset and capturing the overall patterns, “bagImpute” method may be more appropriate. If your main focus is on handling outliers in specific variables, then “imputate_outlier” with “capping” can be a useful approach. Ultimately, the choice depends on your research goals, the characteristics of your data, and the specific context of your analysis.
